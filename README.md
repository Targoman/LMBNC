# LMBNC: Language Model-Based N-gram Corrector
## Goal
Detection and correction of incorrect n-grams existing in corpora.

These incorrect n-grams include incorrect unigrams generated by concatenation of two or more unigrams and incorrect n-grams generated by splitting unigrams. Some of these incorrect n-grams can be detected and corrected only by considering the context of the sentence.  Additional information can be found in our paper.

## Requirements
LMBNC needs Python >= 3.5, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) == 1.5.1 and [fairseq LM](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/language_model) == 0.9.0 .

## Usage
In order to be able to run the LMBNC, you need to follow these steps:

* Train a fairseq language model with the corpora which you want to correct. See [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/language_model) for detailed instructions.
* Use following command to correct the corpus:
```bash
python3 -m LMBNC -i "path/to/input/corpus" -l "path/to/language/model" -o "path/to/output/corpus"
```
**Warning!** If you're dealing with a small sized corpus, the LM may not be trained properly;
Use any additional corpora with the same domain along with the corpus you want to correct to train the LM.
